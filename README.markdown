**coppersmith** is a library to enable the joining, aggregation, and synthesis
of "features", streams of facts about entities derived from "analytical
records".

This library is originated from the Feature Engineering squad within Analytics
& Information at Commonwealth Bank and is maintained by @afcowie, @dkristian,
@triggerNZ, and @toddmowen.


We have a richly detailed [user guide](USERGUIDE.markdown),
which we consider a good introduction to **coppersmith**. PR's to the user
guide as you become familiar with the library are especially encouraged!!!

There is also a [troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.markdown) available.
