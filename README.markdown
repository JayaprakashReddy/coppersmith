Feature Engineering
===================

Omnia Engineering builds the platform which is allowing the Bank to use machine
learning, data science, and advanced modelling on its vast trove of data.
Working in the Data Products portfolio, the Feature Engineering squad is working
to advance the platform, ensure data integrity, improve responsiveness to
customer needs, and develop new capabilities.

 * [Andrew Cowie](https://github.com/afcowie) (Squad Lead)
 * [Kristian Domagala](https://github.com/dkristian), based in Melbourne
