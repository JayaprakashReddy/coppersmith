**coppersmith** is a library to enable the joining, aggregation, and synthesis
of "features", streams of facts about entities derived from "analytical
records".

This library is originated from the Feature Engineering squad within Analytics
& Information at Commonwealth Bank and is maintained by @afcowie, @dkristian,
@triggerNZ, and @toddmowen.
