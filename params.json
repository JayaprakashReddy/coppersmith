  "body": "**Coppersmith** is a library to enable the joining, aggregation, and synthesis of \"features\", streams of facts about entities derived from \"analytical records\".\r\n\r\nThis library was originally written by a squad within the Analytics & Information group at [Commonwealth Bank](https://www.commbank.com.au/), looking to improve the task of authoring and maintaining features for use in predictive analytics and machine learning.\r\n\r\nOur working hypothesis was that for all the complexity of the business domain and the size of the data sets involved, fundamentally the logic used in feature generation can be described as simple functions and those functions should be able to be composed. The framework now called **coppersmith** grew out of our efforts to improve the lives of feature authors.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nWe have a richly detailed [user guide](https://github.com/CommBank/coppersmith/blob/master/USERGUIDE.markdown).\r\n\r\nThere is also a [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/CommBank/coppersmith/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.markdown) available.\r\n\r\nVersioning\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe latest version of **coppersmith** is `0.13.1-20160520015824-5dde44b`.\r\n\r\nThe [change log](https://github.com/CommBank/coppersmith/blob/master/CHANGELOG.markdown) lists all backwards-incompatible changes to the library (i.e. changes which might break existing client code). Any such changes require bumping the second number in the version.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAdd the **coppersmith plugin** to your **SBT configuration** (inside `project/plugins.sbt`).\r\n```\r\naddSbtPlugin(\"au.com.cba.omnia\" %% \"coppersmith-plugin\" % \"0.13.1-20160520015824-5dde44b\")\r\n```\r\nThe plugin adds the appropriate **coppersmith** versions to your build and enables the publishing of feature metadata.\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Kristian Domagala [@dkristian](https://github.com/dkristian)\r\n- Todd Owen [@toddmowen](https://github.com/toddmowen)\r\n- Tin Pavlinic [@triggerNZ](https://github.com/triggerNZ)\r\n- Ewan Vaughan [@ewanv](https://github.com/ewanv)\r\n- Andrew Cowie [@afcowie](https://github.com/afcowie)\r\n- Konstantinos Servis [@knservis](https://github.com/knservis)\r\n- Afsal Thaj [@afsalthaj](https://github.com/afsalthaj)\r\n- TianYi Zhu [@Fantoccini](https://github.com/Fantoccini)\r\n- Michael Thomas [@Michaelt293](https://github.com/Michaelt293)\r\n",
