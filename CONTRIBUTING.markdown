Contributing to Coppersmith
===========================

Code Contributions
------------------
The Coppersmith project welcomes new contributors. Individuals making
contributions should raise a Pull Request from their own fork of Coppersmith.

PRs will be assessed by the Coppersmith Engineers, and will need to be
approved by one of the approvers below.

Any substantial changes, or changes in direction should be discussed in
the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/CommBank/coppersmith) first.

When making code changes, a version bump is required. When making API
breaking changes a major bump is required, otherwise a minor bump is
sufficient.

When bumping the major version, also include an entry in the
[change log](CHANGELOG.markdown) detailing what has changed and how to upgrade.
