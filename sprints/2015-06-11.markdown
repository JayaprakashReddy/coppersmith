Sprinting is an endurance sport
===============================

_9 Jun 2015 through 19 Jun 2015_

Customer Liaison
---------------

We are establishing liaison with three customer projects: CEP, OneCommScore, and
GCPS, and STIG/CAR, with one each of us working through feature generation tickets to get a feel for the different needs they have of Omnia. This is primarily an induction exercise for our new staff, but we will have some features for CEP and GCPS into production over the next few weeks.

Schema Evolution
----------------

Next week we will be concentrating on the question of schema evolution, both as applies to the dependencies that flow through our codebases and the linkages between the datasets as they are transformed from source into features. This will answer the questions raised at the last Omnia Design Forum, but will be a crucial input as we start to consider ways we can approach improving stability and quality.

Kudos
-----

Thanks to [Laurence](https://github.com/laurencer) for the inspiration to use a more story based style to convey our activities, and to do so on GitHub.

And much appreciation goes to [Sujesh](https://github.com/sujeshce) and [Hendra](https://github.com/hendrasuryanto), under whose tutelage we're learning the ropes.
